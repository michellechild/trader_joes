#Trader Joe’s Website Redesign

For my final project at the Iron Yard, I was tasked with redesigning Trader Joe’s site. Note: This is in no way affiliated with Trader Joe’s the company and is simply a school project.

The project includes:

* Homepage
* Our Story
* Our Culture
* Our Food
* Recipes
 

In this repo you will find: 

* #### Content Strategy and Proposal 
I (quickly) gathered company and brand research on Trader Joes and evaluated their current site for content and problems. With this information wrote a proposal highlighting key points from my research and outlining my redesign goals. 

* #### Responsive Sketches
I sketched several concepts for the site, each concept includes a homepage and an our story page. The concept I chose is listed first. 

* #### Responsive Wireframes 
I took my top three concepts and converted them into wireframes made with Adobe Photoshop (six wireframes total). Each includes a small, medium and large version of the site. 

* #### Style Tiles 
With a layout and system in place, I reviewed several of Trader Joe’s products and private label branding to gather color and texture inspiration for the site. I created three style tiles based on similat, yet varying concepts and ultimately chose the one I felt would translate best online, Style Tile #2. This tile allowed for strong color contrasts and subtle but defining textures. 

* #### Typography
Typography was a major decision in this site. I needed to capture their fun, kitschy brand, but still allow for good readability and the chance to highlight the high-quality of the Trader Joe’s brand. I went through several header and body type options and ultimately choose Hooligan for the header font, and Freight-Micro-Pro, a slab serif for the body font. 

* #### Photoshop Comp
The photoshop comp simply marries the wireframe and style tile, and gave me a good starting point when coding. 

* #### Responsive Site Pages
In the final product, I created five pages: the homepage, our story, our culture, our food, and the recipes page. I addressed the trite, repetitive nature of the current site with varying layouts, cleaned up the navigation with better visual weight, and chose colors and type that accurately represented their brand, and used a clean, consistent grid throughout the site.
