					<p><span>It all started in the 50s...<br></span>Would you believe we started out as a small chain of convenience stores? It’s true. Way back in 1958. We were called Pronto Markets. In ‘67, our founder, the original Trader Joe, changed our name (yes, to Trader Joe’s) and the way we do business.
					</p>
					<p>We made the stores bigger (if you can imagine), decked the walls with cedar planks and donned our crew in cool Hawaiian shirts. Most importantly, we started packaging innovative, hard-to-find, great-tasting foods under the “Trader Joe’s” name. That cut our costs and saved you money. Still does. And that’s important, because “Value” is a concept we take very seriously.

					<blockquote>By ‘Value,’ we mean great everyday prices on all of our great products. No sales, no gimmicks, no clubs to join, no special cards to swipe...<br>How do we do it?</blockquote>
					<div class="split">
						<ul>
							<li>We buy direct from suppliers whenever possible, we bargain hard to get the best price, and then pass the savings on to you.</li>
							<li>If an item doesn’t pull its weight in our stores, it goes away to gangway for something else.</li>
							<li>We buy in volume and contract early to get the best prices.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="split">
						<ul>
							<li>Most grocers charge their suppliers fees for putting an item on the shelf. This results in higher prices... so we don’t do it.</li>
							<li>We keep our costs low — because every penny we save is a penny you save.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<blockquote>It’s not complicated. We just focus on what matters.<br> Great food + Great prices = Value.</blockquote>

				<h3>1967</h3>
				<p>The first Trader Joe’s opened its doors in Pasadena, California. Still there today - same spot, same parking lot.</p>
				<p>If you were into wine - especially California wines - Trader Joe’s was the place to go. Still is. But back in the late 1960s, we sold every California wine there was.</p>
				<h3>1969</h3>
				<p>The first Hawaiian shirt was worn. Okay maybe it was the second or third...? Well, it was definitely one of the loudest &amp; may have led to the trademark Trader Joe’s attire.</p>

					<h3>1970</h3>
					<p>Trader Joe’s first customer newsletter - “The Insider Report”- was introduced. In it we told stories about wines we sold. Customers coveted it. They even paid 5 cents for it.</p>
					<h3>1972</h3>
					<p>We launched the first Trader Joe’s private label grocery product – granola. How down to earth.</p>
					<h3>1973</h3>
					<p>“Still trying to find ourselves” - a butcher shop, nuts in barrels, magazines &amp; pantyhose – oh, yes, you could've found all of these items at your localTrader Joe's. (Seriously, pantyhose.)</p>
					<h3>1975</h3>
					<p>A decorative maritime bell was used to get someone’s attention – a signature communication system was born.</p>
					<p>We started cutting &amp; wrapping cheese for the first time. The stores smelled great.</p>
					<h3>1976</h3>
					<p>The first plastic lobster is used as decoration.</p>		
					<h3>1977</h3>
					<p>Trader Joe’s, Trader Mings, Trader Jose, Trader Giotto, Pilgrim Joe – having fun (as usual) while we expanded our private label concept.</p>
					<p>The first reusable “Save-A-Tree” brand canvas bag was introduced at Trader Joe’s. Then re-used. We like to think it's still being used. We also introduced our first private label organic item - Organic Unfiltered Apple Juice.</p>
					<h3>1978</h3>
					<p>We finally stop selling pantyhose. The unencumbered freedom is glorious.</p>

					<h3>1981</h3>
					<p>Trader Joe's was mentioned in a national magazine for our All American Nut Butter. Either it was a pretty slow news week or our nut butter was just that good. (It still is.)</p>
					<h3>1982</h3>
					<p>Our private label canned corn was first introduced to our stores. This classic with the original yellow label remains a popular product today (and it only costs a few more cents than it did in ‘82).</p>
					<h3>1983</h3>
					<p>While introduced as kitschy décor in 1976, now every Trader Joe’s has a plastic lobster for the finding.</p>
					<h3>1984</h3>
					<p>Trader Joe's hit the airwaves - we started recording our own radio ads where we tell the behind-the-scenes stories about our products with a signature sign off - “Thanks for listening.”</p>
					<h3>1985</h3>
					<p>Our newsletter changed from the “Insider Report” to the now iconic “Fearless Flyer,” which is free & still remains the primary form of advertising for us today.</p>
					<h3>1988</h3>
					<p>We took our first big leap outside of Southern California into Northern California where we opened a store in the city of San Rafael. And it was a leap year.</p>
					<h3>1989</h3>
					<p>We finally stopped packaging up almonds and pistachios in our stores. The growers started shipping them to us pre-packaged, in one-pound bags – a fresh idea for even fresher nuts!</p>
